# Introduction

What we're trying to accomplish here is the abiltiy for one tomcat server to host 
many different projects.  We do this by using an apache web server in front of tomcat
so that it can strip off the context. We want to have the hostname respond
without having to worry about the context.  So requests to http://example.com that
have a context of ***'/example'*** are redirected internally.  This makes it transparent
to the end user that there is a context involved.  There is an added benefit that we can 
have the SSL handled by apache (which is easier to implement and more standard) than with
the .jks files needed for tomcat configuration.

This will prompt you to
